	<h1>Effects of Global Warming and What is the Cause?</h1>

    In the model above it shows the cause and effects of global warming and how common pollution like big companies are contributing to global warming.
</p>
	  <p>
    To represent what climate change and pollution is doing to our earth we made a stop motion animation to show what that is happpening in a different way. We used our characters to represent the Earth and pollution. We made it so a fight broke out between the two because it can represent how us poluting us also uf fighting the world.

	  <h1>Storyboard</h1>
	<img src="storyboard.png" alt="Storyboard" width="450">
	<p>
	This is an image of our story board that we created to help us visualize our idea. The idea of our story was to have a fight between the main characters Oil guy and Earth guy. In the first square, you can see that the are starting to argue wth eachother which signifies how in the begining pollution was a problem but not that bad. As the story goes on, the intensity of the fight changes which shows how the pollution and climate change is also inceasing. This ultimately leads to Earth guys "death".

	  <h1>Character Design</h1>
	  <img src="CharacterDesign.JPG" alt="CharacterDesign" width="450">
	  <p>
	  This is showing the characters Earth Man and Oil Guy infront of our set. This is the first version of our set because we didn't know about the sky sheet yet. 
  </p>
	  <h1>Our Code for the Lighting</h1>
	  <pre>
	  forever(function () {
    light.setAll(0x0000ff)
    for (let index = 0; index <= 255; index++) {
        light.setBrightness(index)
        pause(20)
    }
    for (let index = 0; index <= 255; index++) {
        light.setBrightness(255 - index)
        pause(20)
    }
})
		  
	  </pre>
	  <p>
	Shown above is the code we used for the lighting in our animation. This code was specifically used in the scene where the paper was showing the 5 year later time skip. We used it to brighten up the picture because it looked a little dull without it.

	  <h1>Final Animation Video</h1>

</video>
	<p>
	Above is our final animation video. We were trying to express how the Earth is fighting against fossil fuels and pollutions. In the end, we wanted to kind of leave it at a cliff hanger about how even though the Earth is still alive, it is still wounded by the harm we have put it through.	
  </p>
	  <h1>Behind the Scenes!</h1>

	This is a beheind the scenes image of our stop motion animation proccess. While we were finding where to put the characters we snapped a bhind scenes image of our character Oil guy.
